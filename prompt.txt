The following image contains tables in a spreadsheet. For each table you see,
provide me the data in each table in JSON format. I want you to extract the column headers,
row names, and last row of row values in each table separately.

For example if you see the following tables (note the following tables are just examples, not the actual tables in the image.
There may be more or fewer tables in the image than the tables provided below):

TABLE 1
INVENTORY | QUANTITY | PRICE | TOTAL
----------|----------|-------|--------
Apples    | 10       | 2.00  | 20.00
Oranges   | 15       | 1.50  | 22.50

          TABLE 2
          TRIATHLETE | Run | Swim | Cycle
          ----------|----------|-------|--------
Athlete 1 Aaron     | 20       | 2.00 | 20.00
Athlete 2 Mark      | 20       | 1.50 | 6.00

TABLE 3
Company | Stock
----------|----------|
Google   | 1000
Nvidia   | 2000


the output you would give is simply as follows:

{{"Table 1":{{
  "Columns": ["INVENTORY", "QUANTITY", "PRICE", "TOTAL"],
  "Row Names: [],
  "Last Row": ["Oranges", "15", "1.50", "22.50"]
  }},
"Table 2": {{
  "Columns": ["TRIATHLETE", "Run", "Swim", "Cycle"],
  "Row Names: ["Athlete 1", "Athlete 2"],
  "Last Row": ["Mark", "20", "1.50", "6.00"]
  }},
  "Table 3": {{
  "Columns": ["Company", "Stock"],
  "Row Names: ["Athlete 1", "Athlete 2"],
  "Last Row": ["Nvidia", "2000"]
  }}
  }}
  
  No need to place the ```json in the output.
  Please use only curly braces, as in standard JSON format. Don't use square brackets.
  If a cell value is empty, no need to provide it in the JSON representation.
  The Last Row should always have values, not be empty. If it appears that the last row is empty in the image,
  use the closest row above that that is not empty belonging to the same table.

Here are some steps to identify a table/tables
A table is a section of data that is formatted in a way that is easy to read and understand. If there are multiple tables in a spreadsheet,
each table will have its own section, which will most likely be colored differently than the background of the spreadsheet. Tables also will have
a relatively close density of values/colors while empty space will not contain this density.

Make sure to read the tables carefully, line by line, from left to right and accurately extract the given values from each table.

Don't add any additional text apart from the desired values from each table.
Please make sure to capture ALL the tables in the spreadsheet, and ensure each table has its own JSON representation.
However, be sure to check that you are not repeating the same table more than once.
Note that sometimes column headers can span multiple rows.
Make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, and ONLY provide the JSON. Don't add any additional text.

Consider the following txt representation of the spreadsheet in csv format before parsing the image: ${txt_of_business_budget}
